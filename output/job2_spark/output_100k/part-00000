Lowell,1952,media,1,1,502.00,reinforcing its reputation as one of the fastest cars on the road the 1952 mercury packs fords ultimate flathead: the 255 cubic inch 8cm. with a nice bump in compression it made 125 horsepower in 1952 and when paired with a manual transmission with overdrive was a legitimate 100 mph automobile. detailed for show at the time of restoration it still shows quite well although the current owner is adamant that a healthy car is one that is driven regularly so it shows some signs of use today. proper ford script hoses and original style hose clamps add authenticity and youll note that theres a fresh wiring harness and a new battery for the electrical department. it starts quickly and easily with the original 6-volt electrical system and settles into a smooth silent flathead idle almost immediately.the flathead is teamed with a standard 3-speed manual transmission with a borg-warner overdrive unit whose seamless operation is quite impressive even today. in overdrive this car will cruise at 70 mph all day and its transparent operation means youll never really even think twice about it. the chassis also features rust-free floors rebuilt brakes and suspension and a great-sounding dual exhaust system that is typical of the period. four recent coker wide whitewall radials have been fitted to the original steel wheels and it tracks like a cruise missile on the interstate.ask about our certified vehicle program.  do not hesitate to contact james at 1-866-231-2457 to make your purchase arrangements! and remember we service every make and model of every vehicle that we sell. visit us today and experience the difference! buy from the high line group with confidence. we are a 30 year family owned and operated business! we offer very competitive financing rates and terms for all credit levels along with long term extended power-train warranties. the highline group makes every attempt to make sure our listings are factual and accurate. please give us a call if you have a question about any of our vehicles. for more information photos and to view our complete inventory visit us @ www.highlinemotorgroup.com to see more pictures of this vehicle or call us at 978-866-2176 today to schedule your test drive.
