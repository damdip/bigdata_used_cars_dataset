Norwood,1987,media,1,1,76.00,when first introduced in 1976 the porsche 924 was designed as the replacement for its entry-level 914 model. with sales exceeding 150,000 units between 1976 and 1988 the 1924 was considered a sales success. as a testament to how successful the 924 model was for porsche,in 1983 porsche released the 944 as its replacement but demand for the classic 924 carried it production right through 1985. it was then followed by three years of the 944 engined 924 known as the 924s. this brought the 924's run right up until 1988
