Kennett Square,1979,bassa,1,1,8.00,1979 alfa romeo spider veloce it is always difficult to price a special car like this-a 1979 alfa romeo spider veloce.  i\'m looking at comparables from 2014 with nothing sold since 2018!. youd think with covid 19 the price of these collectible classics would be plummeting! but that is not the case and as one of my collector commented this is a buyers market. but finding a rare car in this condition means the sellers have the upper  an advisor to my sellers,i state (be ever so emotional) that this car will never be built again. it can be modified to an electric maybe. but it will never be quite like this. i get so excited when a young person (in my case anyone under 40) gets excited about a car as complicatedly simple as  of my lack of funds in college,italian cars were unthinkable.  see advice below for italian car owners. but it doesn\'t mean that i was always turning my head when something red and exotic flashed by. my generation will be among the last to have grown- up with the thrill
