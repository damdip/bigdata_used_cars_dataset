Concord,2002,media,1,1,125.00,would you ever really be deciding between a collector car with a street-eating v8,and an economy hatchback? of course not! but right now you can pick up a low mileage 2002 35th anniversary chevrolet camaro z28 ss with the slp upgrades,a slick black presentation
Concord,1978,bassa,2,2,377.50,you're looking at the last year for the original z-car.  so this 1978 datsun 280z 2+2 has the iconic design we all love and all the best updates learned over this model's run.  the z cars defined 1970s motoring in america,and that's best represented in one color: gold metallic.  it's that perfect hue that seemed as disco-friendly as the leisure suit forty years ago,and it's still an attention getter today.  but really the reason why the color still works so well is because the original color was given a professional respray later in life to keep this precious metal hue glowing.  plus
Concord,1931,media,1,1,124.00,it's time for one of those terrific hot rod builds where someone has really paid attention to the details.  so this all steel 1931 ford roadster pickup is where vintage style and cool coordination meet v8 power and four-wheel disc brakes to create one cool custom machine.  when people say "wow" at a hot rod,it's usually because someone has sweated the details... and you're going to get plenty of wows with this one.  it all starts with color coordination.  the deep metallic blue knows how to really catch the sunshine.  not only is the smooth steel body painted this color,but also so is the chassis to give this a very sleek look.  and like any good custom street machine
