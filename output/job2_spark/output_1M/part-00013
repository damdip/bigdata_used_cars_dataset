Concord,1975,media,1,1,43.00,the affordable,fun,and nimble german sportscar has really come into its own on the classic market.  this 1975 porsche 914 has a great color combo and the unmistakable feeling of a great driving machine engineered in stuttgart.  and it's all available today at an affordable price.  the 914's design was one of the most interesting porsche ever made.  it follows the same principal of the 911 that made sure the tall fender line helped you understand where the front edges of the car were
Concord,1987,media,2,2,4.00,we love these v8 square-body trucks like this 1987 chevrolet c10 custom deluxe,and everything from the stance to the finish tells you this one is on its way to becoming a very cool patina cruiser.  this truck is unique.  the panels are on their way to a patina look that's absolutely awesome on the classic pickup scene today.  so we bet you're just imagining this warn-in appearance getting sealed with a nice clearcoat.  it would give you a distinct aged two-tone with a gloss that would look good against the bright chrome bumpers and 18-inch ridler alloys.  in fact,it even has the lowered stance and wider rear tires that make for a cool custom truck package.  but even if you're not into patina
Concord,1957,media,2,2,32.50,the 1957 ford fairlane 500s are always in demand because of their unique and intricate styling.  so when you can get a sunliner convertible that has a cool cruiser look and an upgraded dual-quad v8,it means added distinction and power in this already desirable vintage package.  the '57 fords have an exclusive front end that looks like the headlights were frenched right at the factory,and so this style makes it the perfect one to add other upgrades like the fender skirts.  a car like this needs well-fitting doors
Concord,1983,media,1,1,35.00,this is a rare and distinctive collectable from an era where we got very few.  oldsmobile brought us back into the muscle cars days with a taste of the performance we all love.  the 1983 hurst/olds cutlass name was resurrected in time for the partnership's 15th anniversary and celebrated with this low production run of v8 coupes.  so it's great to find such a well-respected and highly-documented example of originality.  the hurst/olds was never about being subtle,and this '83 continues the grand tradition with an awesome black-over-silver paint job,blacked-out trim

Maryville,1963,alta,1,1,226.00,here we have a 1963 ford 300 r code.  this is a very rare opportunity to own a piece of muscle car history.  there were only 50 of these cars ever built and this one is mostly a survivor that has had a repaint done.  it's 1 of only 5 high performance 300's in the 427 registry and 1 of only 3 r codes in the registry.  we were told this car was original bought by warner ford in loveland ohio and raced during '63 and '64. the body on it is rock solid and you can tell it has been extremely well cared for over the years.  it's straight down the sides and all the body lines flow beautifully from front to rear.  as we mentioned it has had a repaint,but it was redone in the rangoon red which is the factory option for it.  it has been buffed and polished to a gorgeous shine that as you can see is slick as a ribbon.  this ford has the factory glass which is all in phenomenal condition.  it also has a lot of its original emblems and stainless which looks amazing as well.  looking at the bumpers you can see they also have a brilliant shine.  to finish off the look it's sitting on the factory style 15" wheels that are painted body color with firestone tires and correct '63 ford dogdish hubcaps. next,we will look at the interior of this r code.  on the inside it looks to be mostly all original and in amazing condition.  this car is done in red and white on the inside which is a beautiful compliment to the rangoon red exterior.  as you can see it has the bench seats with what looks to be the factory covers that are in phenomenal condition for their age. the door panels are also in great condition along with the black vinyl floor.  this '63 has the white headliner with the white visors that all look amazing with the headliner having an excellent fit.  looking at the dash you can see that it all looks stock with the factory gauges working as they should with 1084 miles on the odometer.  the factory steering wheel has been well cared for and of course it has the four speed shifter in the floor!  in the trunk everything looks solid and it has the liners and trunk mat along with the factory jack. finally
