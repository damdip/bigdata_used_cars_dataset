Paramus,1962,alta,1,1,51.00,lamborghini paramus is pleased to present our 1962 porsche 356b super 90 karmann notchback hardtop t6. the notchbacks actually started out from the factory as cabriolets. the first built 1961 karmann notchback t5s were reutter cabriolets that had hard tops welded on permanently. these were the very first porsches built by karmann,but were not badged on the right side fender until the t6 models. the unique karmann hardtop or notchback 356 b model was produced in 1961 and 1962. the 1961 production run was essentially a cabriolet body with the optional steel cabriolet hardtop welded in place. the 1962 line (t6 production) was a very different design in that the new t6 notchback coup body did not start life as a cabriolet,but with its own production designin essence

Buffalo,1965,bassa,1,1,438.00,ford may have created the concept of the postwar american car/pickup but chevrolets el camino kept the idea going. fords new full-size car for 1960 was deemed unsuitable for the ranchero so it moved to the all-new compact falcon for 1960. its also interesting to note that fords sedan delivery the courier moved to the falcon platform as well. another contributing factor for moving it to the new compact platform would be revealed a year later in the form of an all-new 1961 f-100 with unibody construction like the ranchero. this way fords unibody car-based pickup was now sized and priced smaller than the f-100.structurally and cosmetically the ford ranchero was all but a two-door wagon without the rear roof. this was also why it wasnt introduced until mid-way in the model year as it was introduced with the falcon wagons.styling changes and powertrain availability marched lock-step between ranchero and falcon. an optional 260 cubic inch v-8 arrived during 1963 along with expanding to two trim levels with the addition of the deluxe model. the first major change in styling occurred for 1964 when the curved body panels became more blocky and incorporated a stamped in side spear body contour. 1964 also saw an additional trim level added called the deluxe model which had bucket seats and was part of the total performance marketing theme of all ford products that year.1965 was the final year of the ranchero on the falcon platform and it saw minimal cosmetic changes. under the hood however ranchero saw the most changes since 1960. the six grew from its original 144 cubic inch displacement to 170 while the v-8 was now the 289 cubic inch unit that premiered in the full-size and fairlane lines in 1964. classic!!! come check it out today!!! great price!! great condition!! some features include tinted glass am.fm stereo carpeting tan leather upholstery bedliner glass rear window seats 3 wood accent front arm rests and dual exhaust!plus up to $2000 reconditioning fees on qualifying vehicles.  sales tax in your county title and tags not included in vehicle prices shown and must be paid by the purchaser.  while great effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the information on this site errors do occur.  so please verify information with a custom service representative.  this is easily done calling us or visiting us at the dealership.716-886-1626please visit safercar.org to verify if this car has any open recalls.[!@@additional info@@!]am/fm,front split bench seat,leather seats
