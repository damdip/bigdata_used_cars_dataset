we would be happy to facetime this vette with you and go over the whole thing!,we are please to offer for your consideration this 1972 ontario orange chevrolet corvette coupe which has received the prestigious bloomington gold survivor award as well as an ncrs top flight award! this corvette has a great presence to it youll find yourself liking this car more and more everyday as you realize the originality this car has to it! the numbers matching 350 engine runs excellent and has a throaty sound to it while going down the road. paired with a turbo hyra-matic automatic transmission this corvette is enjoyable to drive and with factory options such as power steering power brakes tilt wheel and factory air conditioning (not working) youll find yourself wanting to take this car for a cruise. around the ontario orange exterior  (code 987) youll find nearly all original factory lacquer paint and the factory bonding stripes on both quarter panels as well as front fenders and around where the rear deck meets the back of the bumper. being the last year for front and rear chrome bumpers youll be pleased to know that both still have a great shine to them and the egg-crake grill side fender grills and more all show excellent. the removable rear window and painted t-tops all show excellent as well! throughout the saddle tan vinyl interior youll find that all the gauges are in working order including the tach and clock! the stereo system works well although i am not sure why you would want to listen to it when you can listen to the rumble from the engine!

Columbus,1966,alta,1,1,25.00,here is a 1966 corvette roadster with 31050 actual miles on it...it was in the same family from 1970... the paint was poor..so it was recently treated to a professional repaint in the correct milano maroon. the top is older but still in good condition. the bright work is good. original hubcaps still in good condition...interior is original...door panels seats carpets.. the only negative is a wear spot on drivers side floor. under hood is left original...easy detail if you are so inclined.....they are only original once.....this car was maintained mechanically over the years...it runs and drives like it did in 1966....rare car with ..telescoping steering wheel,radio delete and power steering.....close your eyes..it is 1966 all over again !!!!!
